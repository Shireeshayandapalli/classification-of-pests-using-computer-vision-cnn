Classifying pests in agricultural settings using computer vision and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a powerful approach to automated pest detection. CNNs are highly effective for image classification tasks, as they can automatically learn relevant features from images (e.g., shapes, textures, and patterns) without needing hand-crafted feature extraction
